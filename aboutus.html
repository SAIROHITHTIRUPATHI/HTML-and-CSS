        <p>The earliest means of transport in history were simply walking and swimming. After animals were domesticated,
            human beings used them for riding and carrying load. Invention of wheel laid the foundation of the modern
            transport systems. The steam engine revolutionised rail transport, while the first aircraft designed by
            Wright Brothers in 1903 gave an impetus to air transport.
        </p>
        <p>In India, a number of transport systems, both obsolete and new, co-exist simultaneously. In Kolkata, hand
            driven carriages are still prevalent, despite attempts to ban them. Animal transport includejfnse of animals
            such as donkey, horse, mule, buffalo etc. These are more common in villages. In hilly areas, mule and yak
            are used to climb to higher altitudes. Road vehicle transport includes bus, auto-rickshaws, taxis, cars,
            scooters, bikes and bicycles. Well-developed bus services are known to operate only in few Indian cities.
            Over 80% of road traffic is occupied by personal instead of public transport.</p>
        <p>However, with the advent of air-conditioned and low floor buses in most cities, people are preferring to use
            them, over their personal vehicles. Bengaluru was the first city in India to introduce Volvo buses in 2006
            and it is also the first to establish an air-conditioned bus stop. Chennai house is one of Asia’s biggest
            bus terminus. The oldest Indian state transport system is that of North Bengal State Transport Corporation
            and is still in operation.</p>
        <p>Taxis also run in a number of cities. The older ones used, were the Padmini or Ambassador taxis. In
            Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, they are hired through phone, while in Kolkata and Mumbai, they can be
            rented on the roads. Since 2006, radiotaxis have become quite popular owing to the safety they confer.</p>
        <p>Auto-rickshaws or three-wheelers are also common in several cities, like Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad. They
            may be colour-coded as black or green depending on whether they use petrol or CNG, respectively. Metro rail
            network is one of the latest introductions in several Indian cities. Kolkata Metro is the oldest metro,
            followed by the Delhi Metro, which started in 2002. The Namma Metro in Bengaluru is India’s third metro
            system, which began in 2011.</p>
        <p>These metro rails have been highly successful, carrying lakhs of passengers per day. They have not only eased
            road traffic, but have made travel cheaper, safer and convenient. Directorate General of Civil Aviation
            (DGCA) is the national body that regulates the aviation industry. Air India plays a major role in connecting
            India with the world. IGI Airport, Delhi is the busiest airport of India in terms of passenger traffic.
